## 📖 About the Project

Every day, people misplace valuable items such as phones, wallets, or ID cards in public places — and finding them can be difficult.  
**FindItNow** bridges that gap by offering a digital space where users can:

- Post about **lost** or **found** items  
- Search and filter listings easily  
- Browse through organized cards with clear visuals  

This project focuses on building a **clean, responsive frontend** interface that can later be integrated with a backend for real-time interactions.
